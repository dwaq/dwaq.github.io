		<p>The PCB is tested as working, but my programmer currently can only program 2 megabits of the 4 megabit flash chip. I am working on a fix for my programmer, but currently the Homebrew Gameboy Cartridge works without a hitch on files 2 megabits or smaller.</p>

		<p>Visit my GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/dwaq/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge">https://github.com/dwaq/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge</a> for details.</p>

			<h2>Files Needed</h2>
		</div>

		<p>All digital files that are available, including the schematic, board files, code, and gerbers are located on my <a href="https://github.com/dwaq/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge">GitHub</a>.</p>

		<h4>Some notes:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The schematic and board files were designed in Eagle V6.0. I have created all of the parts for this project. They are located in the <a href="https://github.com/dwaq/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge/blob/master/gameboy.lbr">gameboy.lbr</a> file.</li>
			<li>I used ITEAD Studio's <a href="http://iteadstudio.com/store/images/produce/PCB/PCB%20prototype/ITeadstudio_DRC.rar">DRC file for Eagle</a> to try and meet their limitations for board design. There are errors from solder mask placement, but the boards turned out fine with them.</li>
			<li>I used Sparkfun's <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorial/Eagle-DFM/sfe-gerb274x.cam">CAM file for Eagle</a> to export the board files into gerbers. The gerbers that I sent to ITEAD Studio to be manufactured are located in <a href="https://github.com/dwaq/Homebrew-Gameboy-Cartridge/tree/master/GerberFiles">the GerberFiles folder of my github</a> for anybody that wants their own board without having to go through all the steps to export it theirselves. Keep in mind the drill files use 2:4 Leading.</li>

			<h2>Future Plans</h2>
		</div>

		<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/printrbot/printrbot-your-first-3d-printer">Printrbot from Kickstarter</a> because I've been interested in 3D printing and thought this was the best and lowest-cost way of doing it myself. When I finally recieve it, I will design a case for this game. I will add the files when I finally make it.</p>
		<p>I have also thought about making another version of this cartridge that uses a more spacious flash chip and would have battery backup for saves. The trouble I am having is finding a flash chip that I have the ability to program, yet can also fit on the PCB.</p>
		<p>I would also like to make a programmer so the flash chip would not have to be removed from the cartridge for programming.</p>
